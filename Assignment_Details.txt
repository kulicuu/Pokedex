Pokédex
Ash and his friends have been on the road for quite a while now and they need your
help!
On one of their latest adventures in the Kanto region, Pikachu was battling an unknown
Pokémon. While Ash was trying to identify this unknown Pokémon he dropped and
broke his Pokédex — not good.
Good thing we have you, Pokédex Software Extraordinaire! Your job is to help Ash and
his friends build a new Pokédex.
What's a Pokédex?
A Pokédex is a way for Ash and his friends to identify any Pokémon. You can think of a
Pokédex as a dictionary for Pokémon. Every Pokémon has an entry in a Pokédex and
can be looked up.
Business Requirements
Our friends over at https://pokeapi.co/ have created a REST API that has all the
identification information you could need for every Pokémon. Using this REST API,
build a Pokédex for Ash and his friends.
This new Pokédex should have useful functionality. Ash and his friends have said that
the new Pokédex must include:
A way to search for any Pokémon and receive identification information:
Abilities
Color
Evolution's
Genders
Locations
Moves
Type
Varieties
A way to click on a Pokémon evolution type and see information about that
evolution type
A way to look at past Pokémon that have been searched
