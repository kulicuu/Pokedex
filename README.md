#  Pokedex

This is a assigned project for a job-market assessment.  Pokedex for Pokemon.  I know nothing about Pokemon, but I'm learning.


### So...:

So the requirements are quite clear.  Although I have my own React+Coffeescript pattern that doesn't use JSX (or CSX), here I'm enjoining the stack requirements as an opportunity to re-acquaint myself with the most recent and up-to-date industry-standard React patterns.


### Status:

- [x] State-management (Redux) and a unified effects-management API.
- [x] Initial data fetches for main attributes.
- [x] Autocomplete filter for attributes, with the tree generation computations done in a WebWorker.
- [ ] UI/functionality finalized.
